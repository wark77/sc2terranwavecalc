This calculator should allow you to experiment with terran production quickly.  Try to balance constant unit production with income and supply approaching 0 in the bottom aggregators.  Income is measured in numbers of active SCVs.

Bases are assumed to be orbitals using constant MULEs, providing 19.67 mineral workers and 6 gas.
Half bases are 8 mineral workers + a MULE for 11.67 mineral workers, and 6 gas.
